# Lung Cancer Detection: Theoretical Concepts
## Core Approach
This project implements a deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying lung cancer from CT scan images. It utilizes transfer learning with convolutional neural networks to identify four distinct conditions: normal lung tissue, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.
Machine Learning Methodology
Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled CT scan images to classify them into predefined cancer categories
Transfer Learning: Uses pre-trained Xception architecture to leverage features learned from millions of images
Fine-Tuning: Two-phase approach with gradual unfreezing of layers to adapt the model to medical imaging
## Data Handling Concepts
Data Augmentation: Applies transformations to increase dataset diversity and improve generalization
Class Imbalance Handling: Implements class weights to ensure model performs well on less common cancer types
Stratified Sampling: Maintains proportional representation of classes across training and validation sets
## Computer Vision Techniques
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping): Visualizes regions of the image that influenced the classification
Edge Detection: Uses Sobel operators to highlight tissue boundaries and structural features
Nodule Detection: Implements multi-scale detection algorithms to identify potential cancer nodules
Image Segmentation: Applies watershed algorithms to separate and highlight regions of interest
## Model Training Concepts
Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss: Optimizes model for multi-class classification tasks
Learning Rate Scheduling: Reduces learning rate when performance plateaus to fine-tune model weights
Early Stopping: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation performance
Batch Normalization: Stabilizes and accelerates neural network training
## Evaluation Metrics
Multi-class ROC Analysis: Evaluates performance across different decision thresholds
Confusion Matrix Interpretation: Analyzes patterns of correct and incorrect classifications
Precision-Recall Trade-offs: Balances sensitivity and specificity for optimal clinical utility
## Medical Imaging Considerations
Radiological Feature Detection: Identifies subtle patterns associated with different cancer types
Structure Preservation: Maintains anatomical relevance while processing images
Clinical Interpretation: Bridges the gap between computational outputs and medical decision-making
